# Hardening-Windows
This repository contains various files that can be helpful to securing and hardening a Windows Operating System. 
Mainly, composed by me for the competition Cyber Patriot, these could be used for all sorts of things such as personal security or security in the workplace.
In the GPO folder, you will find various GPOs to apply which will strengthen the security of the machine.
In the Powershell Folder, you will find powershell scripts that one can run. Note: Powershell is tested for latest powershell edition, 5.
